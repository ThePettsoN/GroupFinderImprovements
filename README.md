## GroupFinderImprovements
 
### Overview
GroupFinderImprovements is an addon to help you improve Blizzards built in Group Finder tool. It allows you to, for instance, filter by group composition, automatically refresh the results, and blacklist players.
 
### Features
- Auto-refresh the search results
- Filter on group composition by for example only showing groups with 1 tank and 1 healer, or with 3 or more players in the group
- Blacklist players that you don't want to see in the list

 
### How to use
GroupFinderImprovements comes with its own window that is linked with Blizzard's Group Finder tool. It allows you to easily set change the parameters on the fly. It also adds new buttons to the Group Finder tool to display/hide the addon, as well as start or stop the auto-refresher.

### Known Limitations
Unfortunately due to some decision from Blizzard it's impossible to extract the comments from each entry and filter based on it. That means there's no clear way of removing advertisement entries automatically.
